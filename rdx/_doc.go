// #   Replicated Data Interchange (RDX CRDT) library

// Our goal here is to create a format and a library for data
// replication using state-of-the-art Replicated Data Types.
// Replicated Data interchange format ([RDX][j]) is like protobuf,
// but CRDT. Apart from [RPC][p] applications, one can use it for
// data storage, distributed and asynchronous data exchange and in
// other similar applications. RDX fully supports local-first,
// offline-first and peer-to-peer replication, with no central
// server required, as any two *replicas* can merge their data. By
// installing RDX data types as merge operators in an LSM database
// (leveldb, RocksDB, pebble, Cassandra, etc) one can effectively
// have a CRDT database (which [Chotki](./ARCHITECTURE.md) basically is).

// We will implement *unified* CRDTs able to synchronize using
// operations, full states or deltas. Types may imply [causal
// consistency][x] of updates in matters of performance, but their
// correctness does not depend on that. RDX data types are fully
// commutative, associative and idempotent. Hence, immune to
// reordering or duplication of updates.

// The default syncing protocol (not described here) generally
// relies on [version vectors][v]. Do not confuse that with [vector
// clocks][r] used by Amazon Dynamo and similar systems. While
// there are strong parallels, inner workings of VV and VC are not
// identical.

// ##  Data types

// Our objects can have fields of the following CRDT types. Each
// type is named by a letter.

//  1. last-write-wins variables (`I` for int64, `S` for string, `F`
//     is float64, and `R` is [id64](./id.go#12))
//  2. counters, `N` increment-only uint64 and `Z` two-way int64
//  3. maps (M), like key-value maps, where keys and values are `FIRST`
//  4. sets (E), contain arbitrary `FIRST` elements
//  5. arrays (L) of arbitrary `FIRST` elements
//  6. version vectors (V)
//  7. codegen

// The format and the merge rules are as follows.

// ### `FIRST` Float, Integer, Reference, String, Term

// The last-write-wins register is the simplest data type to
// implement. For each LWW field, we only need the latest "winner"
// op containing the logical timestamp and the value per se. A
// logical timestamp is a pair `{rev, src}` where `rev` is the
// revision number and `src` is the id of the author. For example,
// let's see how a bare (no TLV envelope) `I` int64 `-11` would
// look like, assuming it is the 4th revision of the register
// autored by replica #5. The TLV would look like: `32 08 05 15`
// (hex) where `0x15` is a [zig-zag][g] encoded and zipped `-11`,
// while `32 08 05` is a tiny [ToyTLV](../protocol/tlv.go) record for a zipped pair
// of ints, 4 (signed, zig-zagged, so `08`) and 5 (unsigned, so
// `05`). If we add a ToyTLV envelope, that becomes `69 04 32 08 05
// 15` (type of record `I`, length 4, then the bare part).

// String `S` values are simply UTF-8 strings. Int64 `I`, float64
// `F` and id64 `R` values get compressed using [`zip_int`](./zipint.go)
// routines. Overlong encodings are forbidden both for strings and
// for zip-ints!

// `T` ops have a timestamp, but no value. That is the equivalent
// of a `nil` or `void` value. Those are used as placeholders in
// various cases.

// The string value for `FIRST` types is as follows:

//  1. `F` the e-notation, JSON-like
//  2. `I` signed integer notation,
//  3. `R` 5-8-3 hex notation (e.g. `c187-3a62-12`)
//  4. `S` double-quoted JSON-like, e.g. "Sarah O\'Connor"
//  5. `T` null

// Merge rules for LWW are straighforward:

//  1. higher revision wins
//  2. in case of a tie, higher value wins (like bytes.Compare())
//  3. in case of a tie, who cares, but higher replica id wins

// ### `NZ` Counters

// `N` are increment-only counters. Their TLV state is a sequence
// of `T` records containing zipped uint64 pairs {val,src}, the
// counter value and source replica id. As the counter is inc-only,
// we may use the value itself as a revision number. The merge
// operator is per-replica `max`, as later versions are greater.
// The native value is the sum of all replica values (sum of
// contributions).

// `Z` are two-way counters (inc/dec). Their TLV format is a
// sequence of `I` records each having `{rev,src}` metadata as
// described in the `FIRST` section. One record corresponds to one
// source, per-source merge rules are same as LWW. The native value
// is the sum of all `I` values.

// ### `E` Eulerian

// Generic sets containing any `FIRST` elements. The TLV format is
// a sequence of enveloped FIRST records. It can contain records
// with negative revision numbers. Those are tombstones (deleted
// entries). For example, `I{4,5}-11` from the `FIRST` example
// would go as `69 04 32 08 05 15`. Then, if replica #3 would want
// to remove that entry, it will issue a tombstone op `I{-5,3}-11`
// or `69 04 32 09 03 15`. Here, the version number changes from
// `08` to `09` or 4 to -5, the author changes to 3.

// Within a set, the ops are sorted in the *value order*. Namely,
// if the type differs, they go in the alphabetical order (`F`,
// `I`, `R`, `S`, `T`). If the type is the same, they go in the
// ascending order, as per `strcmp` or `bytes.Compare`. That way,
// merging multiple versions of a set only requires one parallel
// pass of those, no additional allocation or sorting, very much
// like [mergesort][m] works.

// The string value for a set is like `{1,2,3}` where `1,2,3` are
// `FIRST` elements of the set.

// ### `M` Mapping

// Generic maps, mapping any `FIRST` value to any other `FIRST`
// value. The TLV format is a sequence of enveloped key-value op
// pairs. Any update should also contain the affected key-value
// pairs. Deleted entries might have `T` values (the key is
// present, the value is null) or the key might have a negative
// revision (no such key present).

// Pairs are sorted in the value-order of their keys. When merging
// two pairs having an identical value of their keys, both the key
// and the value ops are merged according to the LWW rules. As with
// `E` sets, this only requires one parallel pass of the versions.

// The string value for a map is like `{4:null, "key":"value"}`

// ### `L` Linear

// Generic arrays store any `FIRST` elements. Internally, `L` are
// Causal Trees (also known as Replicated Growable Arrays, RGAs).
// The TLV format is a sequence of enveloped FIRST ops. The
// order of the sequence is a *weave*, i.e. ops go in the same
// order as they appear(ed) in the resulting array. Deleted ops
// change to tombstones, same as E.

// The merging procedure follows the tree-traversal logic. Any
// change to an array must have a form of *subtrees*, each one
// arranged in the same weave order, each one prepended with a `T`
// op specifying its attachment point in the edited tree.

// Deletions look like `T` ops with negative revision numbers. As
// an example, suppose we have an array authored by #3 `I{1,3}1
// I{2,3}2 I{3,3}3` or `[1,2,3]` and replica #4 wants to delete the
// first entry. Then, it issues a patch `T{1,3}T{-4,4}` that merges
// to produce `I{1,3}1 T{-4,4} I{2,3}2 I{3,3}3` or `[2,3]`.

// The string value for an array is like `[1,2,3]`

// ### `V` Version vector

// [Version vector][v] is a way to track dataset versions in a
// causally ordered system. It is a vector of `seq` numbers, where
// each `seq` is the version of the state as seen by each
// respective replica. Alternatively, that is a map `{src: seq}`,
// where `src` is the replica `id`. It is assumed, that we received
// updates from replica `src` all the way up to `seq`.

// Bare TLV for a version vector is a sequence of `V` records (yes,
// `V` nested in `V`) each containing one id64 as a zipped seq-src
// pair (see ZipUint64Pair). The sequence is sorted in the
// ascenting order of record bytes, like `bytes.Compare()`.

// The merge algorithm for version vectors is simple: take the
// maximum `seq` for each `src`. Note that `seq=0` is distinct from
// having no record.

// ##  Data type implementation

// To fully implement an RDT one has to implement these 10
// functions. The function name starts with the type name letter,
// here we imply `I` last-write-wins int64.

// ````go
//     // Xvalid verifies validity of a bare TLV record.
//     // Any other function may assume the input is valid.
//     func Ivalid(tlv []byte) bool

//     // Xstring converts a TLV representation into a string.
//     func Istring(tlv []byte) (txt string)

//     // Xparse converts a string back into bare TLV.
//     // Must round-trip with Xstring.
//     func Iparse(txt string) (tlv []byte)

//     // Xtlv converts the native type into a TLV, zero metadata.
//     func Itlv(i int64) (tlv []byte)

//     // Xnative converts TLV into the native value.
//     // Must round-trip with Xtlv.
//     func Inative(tlv []byte) int64

//     // Xdelta produces a TLV value that, once merged with
//     // the old TLV value using Xmerge, will produce the new
//     // native value using Xnative. Returns nil if none needed.
//     // This function we need to *save changes* from a native
//     // object/struct into RDX.
//     func Idelta(tlv []byte, new_val int64) (tlv_delta []byte)

//     // Xmerge CRDT-merges several bare TLV values into the
//     // resulting one. For example, given two I records
//     // {3,8}15 and {4,1}44 will return {4,1}44 as version 4 is
//     // newer than version 3.
//     func Imerge(tlvs [][]byte) (tlv []byte)

//     // Xdiff produces a TLV delta given a TLV value and a
//     // version vector of suspected changes (may skip this).
//     func Idiff(tlv []byte, vvdiff VV) (tlv []byte)
// ````

// ##  Serialization format

// We use the [ToyTLV](../protocol/tlv.go) format for enveloping/nesting all data.
// That is a bare-bones type-length-value format with zero
// semantics. What we put into ToyTLV envelopes is integers,
// strings, and floats. Strings are UTF-8, no surprises. Floats are
// taken as raw bits and treated same as integers. id64 is stored
// as a compressed pair of integers.

// A note on integer compression. From the fact that protobuf
// has about ten integer types, one can guess that things can
// be complicated here. We use [ZipInt](./zipint.go) routines to produce
// efficient varints in a TLV format (differently from protobuf
// which has a separate bit-level [LEB128][b] coding for ints).

//   - ZipUint64 packs an integer skipping all leading zeroes
//   - ZipUint64Pair packs a pair of ints, each one taking 1,2,4 or
//     8 bytes
//   - ZipZagInt64 packs a signed integer using the zig-zag coding
//   - ZipFloat64 packs a float (integers and binary fractions pack
//     well)

// id64 and logical timestamps get packed as pairs of uint64s. All
// zip codings are little-endian.

// ##  Enveloping

// RDX values can be bare, enveloped or double-enveloped. We use
// bare values when we already know what field of what object we
// are dealing with and what RDT it belongs to. That might be the
// case when we read a value from a key-value storage where the key
// contains object id, field and RDT. In such a case, a bare
// Integer is like `{3,2}1` or `32 03 02 02`.

// Within a network packet, that integer may need to be
// single-enveloped: `I({3,2}1)` or `69 04 32 03 02 02` assuming
// the other metadata is known from the context.

// A bare `ELM` or `NZ` value would only contain a sequence of
// single-enveloped `FIRST` values. To make that single-enveloped
// we only prepend a TLV header.

// In case we also have to convey the rest of the metadata, namely
// the object id and the field, we have to use the double-enveloped
// form. For a simple `map[string]string{"Key":"Value"}` that
// looks like: `M({b0b-af0-3} S({0,0}"Key") S({0,0}"Value"))` or
// `6D 15  36 03 00 af 00 0b 0b  73 04 30 4b 65 79  73 06 30 56 61 6c 75 65`.
// For `FIRST` values, there is no need to use two nested TLV
// records, so a double-enveloped Integer looks like:
// `I({b0b-af0-7}{3,2}1)`

// Object/fields ids are serialized as tiny `ZipUint64Pair`s.
// Revisions are serialized as tiny `ZipIntUint64Pair`s.
